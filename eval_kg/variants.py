"""Part B: blast-radius variants. Each returns {affected asset: hops} for an alerted asset a (a itself excluded).

    B0  no blast radius
    B1  unrestricted: every Asset within k hops of a over any edge type of the unified graph (Neo4j)
    B2  zone-level: every host in a's zone or in a zone the policy connects (outbound for compromise,
        inbound for disruption), ignoring CONNECTS_TO
    B3  ours, undirected: CONNECTS_TO edges allowed by the zone policy, in either direction (no impact mode)
    B4  ours (paper Algorithm 1): E_R in the direction of the impact mode, k = 1
    B5  ours at k = 2 and k = 3
`distances_for_p` gives each variant's reachable set with hop distances for P(u) (Eq. 16), unbounded where the
variant has no depth of its own.
